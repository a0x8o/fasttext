Invoke a command without arguments to list available arguments and their default values:

```bash
$ ./fasttext supervised
Empty input or output path.

The following arguments are mandatory:
  -input              training file path
  -output             output file path

  The following arguments are optional:
  -verbose            verbosity level [2]

  The following arguments for the dictionary are optional:
  -minCount           minimal number of word occurences [5]
  -minCountLabel      minimal number of label occurences [0]
  -wordNgrams         max length of word ngram [1]
  -bucket             number of buckets [2000000]
  -minn               min length of char ngram [3]
  -maxn               max length of char ngram [6]
  -t                  sampling threshold [0.0001]
  -label              labels prefix [__label__]

  The following arguments for training are optional:
  -lr                 learning rate [0.05]
  -lrUpdateRate       change the rate of updates for the learning rate [100]
  -dim                size of word vectors [100]
  -ws                 size of the context window [5]
  -epoch              number of epochs [5]
  -neg                number of negatives sampled [5]
  -loss               loss function {ns, hs, softmax} [ns]
  -thread             number of threads [12]
  -pretrainedVectors  pretrained word vectors for supervised learning []
  -saveOutput         whether output params should be saved [0]

  The following arguments for quantization are optional:
  -cutoff             number of words and ngrams to retain [0]
  -retrain            finetune embeddings if a cutoff is applied [0]
  -qnorm              quantizing the norm separately [0]
  -qout               quantizing the classifier [0]
  -dsub               size of each sub-vector [2]
```

Defaults may vary by mode. (Word-representation modes `skipgram` and `cbow` use a default `-minCount` of 5.)
